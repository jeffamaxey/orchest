"""Provides a simple migration layer for pipeline jsons.

Given a pipeline version, a mapping will be used to establish if the
pipeline should be migrated, that is, modified in place, until it is
brought to the latest version used in Orchest.

If you are to implement a new migration add another _migrate_...
function following the given convention: 1.0.0 -> _migrate_1_0_0. Then
add a mapping to the "_version_to_migration_function" dictionary to
map the current version to the migration function and the version to
which it will migrate.

Note that the system only supports forward migrations.
